## Hi there, I'm Albin Touma ðŸ‘‹

I work as a researcher, data analyst and developer in the space of OSINT and anti-money laundering solutions. My interest is in illicit finance and its relationship to transnational crime and war. 

- [Groupint](https://github.com/OSINT-for-Ukraine/groupint) is an OSINT tool that I helped develop as part of OSINT for Ukraine's R&D team. This tool helps OSINT investigators identify threat actors and networks on Telegram
- [Know Your Sanctions](https://knowyoursanctions.com) is a simple open-source sanctions screening platform that I launched.
- [Illicit Finance](https://illicitfinance.eu) is where I publish research and the latest on transnational crime, corruption, and anything related to illicit finance.
